Deakin Newsletter Signup - Welcome Email Demo

 * Task 2.1P
   
 * I have opted to use Ethereal for email testing, through the nodemailer package.
 * This is instead of 
 * 1. MailChimp (as it is a paid service now, even at the lowest tier)
 * 2. SendGrid (which requires phone verification; I would prefer to avoid using my personal phone number)
 * 3. Mailgun (which also requires phone verification / payment)
   
 * Ethereal allows for demo emails to be "sent" as a preview link for viewing in the browser.
 * It also fulfils the requirement of the code being asynchronous, and mimics real email APIs.
 * Thus, for the purposes of a learning/demo excercise, I believe it is a suitable choice.
